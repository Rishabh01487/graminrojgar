GraminRozgar - Village Employment Platform
🎯 The Problem: Rural Employment Crisis

Economic Drain from Villages
Rural India faces a severe economic crisis where ₹2,500+ Crores worth of village work goes to urban contractors annually. This creates a vicious cycle:

Money that should circulate within villages flows out to cities

Local artisans struggle to find work within their communities

Village economies become dependent on external labor

Skill Migration & Brain Drain
60%+ skilled artisans are forced to migrate to cities for employment, leading to:

Critical skill shortages in villages

Empty homes and broken families

Loss of community cohesion and cultural erosion

Traditional crafts (pottery, weaving, carpentry) facing extinction

Lack of Digital Infrastructure
Rural areas suffer from:

No organized platform connecting local demand with local supply

Poor visibility of available skills within communities

Inefficient matching of artisans with job opportunities

Limited access to digital payments and formal employment systems
